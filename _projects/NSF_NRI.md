**(joint work with Drs. Kamalapurkar, Jacob, Kara, Vance and Fala at OSU)**

- Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) technologies found many civil, commercial, and military applications.
- Infrastructure, such as NASA UAS traffic management (UTM) for low-altitude airspace management and monitoring, is being developed.
- Safety and efficiency of sUAS operations are strongly impacted by low-altitude gusts:
  - Negatively affect pilot operations, reduced flight time, damage
  - Airspace management and allocation made conservative and inefficient.

**Our Hypothesis**

‘In-time’ or ‘real-time’ wind field information, communicated effectively to pilots and traffic management, can enhance safety, efficiency, and robustness of future sUAS operations in
low-altitude airspace.
