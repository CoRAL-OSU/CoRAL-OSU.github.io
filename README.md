# Site Maintenance

This site is a modified variation of the _al-folio_ Jekyll theme. See the original repository [here](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) for more info. Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning it converts a group of non-html files (in this case markdown or .md) into a correctly formatted stack of html. This conversion is performed automatically by Github every time a change is made to the repository. Changes can be tested on a locally-hosted repository by installing Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Structure

The site is split into several logical components. _Pages_ define the layout of individual web pages, such as the home page (about.md), Publications (publications.md), and research (projects.md). The pieces that are displayed on these pages are part of _collections_. A collection is a grouping of similar pieces of data.

For example, the \_pages/people.md file denotes the structure of the People page. It then uses the files within \_people to fill out its content. Adding a new person is as simple as adding a new file to the \_people folder with the correct header information. Layout is handled automatically by the \_pages/people.md file.

Each file has a piece of header information. This defines useful variables relevant to that page. Undergraduates and graduates have different amounts of information. An example would be:

```
---
name: Max DeSantis
interests: Multi-agent systems, harsh environment robotics, distributed control.
category: Undergraduate
image: mdesantis.jpg
current: true
---
```

Adding a new research project is as simple as adding a new markdown file to \_projects/. The projects have a small amount of header information to allow for sorting and displaying on the research home page. Otherwise, their formatting is handled directly with markdown.

# Markdown

Details on markdown styling can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It allows for rich text editing using simple notations, somewhat similar to LaTeX although more elementary. It is modelled after many of html's sructures.

You can include raw html inside a markdown file. An example may be:
```
This is example text within the markdown file.
- Here is a bullet point
- Here is another bullet point.

**Bold text is here**

<h3>Here is an html header</h3>

### Here is that same html header, but in markdown.

## Publications

Publications are handled by the \_pages/publications.md file, the \_config.yml file, and the \_bibliography/papers.bib file. They can be stored in the papers.bib in BibTex format - any additions will be automatically updated and reflected on the site. They are generated by a plugin called [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) which has configuration information defined in the config.yml file. This configuration defines the format of the citations and their ordering/grouping.

Publications in papers.bib can be cited within other pages on the website, with an ending reference list generated automatically. This is described in detail within the jekyll-scholar documentation, but here is an example:

If you include {% cite \<key\> %} within a md file, with \<key\> being the relevant BibTex key, the in-text citation will be included. To generate a references section simply include {% bibliography --cited %} at the end of the markdown file.

## Liquid

The {% ... %} terminology is called [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) and it allows for automatic generation of html during the Jekyll compilation phase. It is used heavily inside the \_pages/ sections to allow for a dynamic number of html objects to be constructed from a known collection. It can be thought of as introducing light structural programming elements into html itself as there are loops, variables, conditionals, branching, sorting, etc.

## Math

LaTeX can be written directly in a .md file. It is handled by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) (a lightweight version of the LaTeX math engine).

## Images

Images should be stored in the assets folder under a sufficiently descriptive folder structure. They can be referenced from anywhere inside the site. An example, from the \_pages/about.md (homepage) file:

```
<div class="row mt-3 mb-3 w-50 m-auto">
    <img src = "{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/about/research_interest_loops.png" class="m-auto img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" alt="Research Loops" title="Research loops">
</div>
```
This creates an html division to hold the image and allow formatting. Each "class" tag defines a specific group of css (styling) traits to be applied. _row_ is a container class indicating it will have interior content elements. _mt-3_ applies a top margin of 30%, _mb-3_ applies a bottom margin of 30%, _w-50_ makes the division's width 50% of it's parent (the overall page) and _m-auto_ automatically adjusts the margins to center the image.

As for the image itself, _img-fluid_ makes the image resize automtically. _rounded_ applies rounded edges and _z-depth_ "lifts" the image off the page, including a shadow. These allow for some visual customization.

These classes are either an internal component of _Bootstrap_, a popular styling framework included on this site or contained inside the \_sass folder.

## Styling

CSS styles are handled inside \_sass. \_base.scc defines most custom classes used throughout the site. \_themes.scss sets global colors using variables defined inside the \_variables.scss file. Note that a dark mode is technically supported, but I disabled it.

## Features

### Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/publications-screenshot.png" width=800></p>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Author annotation:</strong></summary>

In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in `_config.yml`:
```
scholar:
  last_name: Einstein
  first_name: [Albert, A.]
```
If the entry matches the last name and one form of the first names, it will be underlined.
Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.
The coauthor data format in `_data/coauthors.yml` is as follows,
```
"Adams":
  - firstname: ["Edwin", "E.", "E. P.", "Edwin Plimpton"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams

"Podolsky":
  - firstname: ["Boris", "B.", "B. Y.", "Boris Yakovlevich"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky

"Rosen":
  - firstname: ["Nathan", "N."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen

"Bach":
  - firstname: ["Johann Sebastian", "J. S."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach

  - firstname: ["Carl Philipp Emanuel", "C. P. E."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach
```
If the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided.

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
